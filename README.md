# TinyML-based Time-Series Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple example of applying lightweight machine learning methods for time-series prediction, inspired by TinyML concepts.

### 🧩 Objective
To design and test a small predictive model suitable for low-power or embedded systems (e.g., IoT sensors or industrial devices).

### ⚙️ Methods
- Python, NumPy, and Scikit-learn  
- Linear regression for time-series forecasting  
- Lightweight model that can be converted to TensorFlow Lite (TinyML-compatible)
