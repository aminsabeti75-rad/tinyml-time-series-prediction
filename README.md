# TinyML-based Time-Series Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple example of applying lightweight machine learning methods for time-series prediction, inspired by TinyML concepts.

### 🧩 Objective
To design and test a small predictive model suitable for low-power or embedded systems (e.g., IoT sensors or industrial devices).

### ⚙️ Methods
- Python, NumPy, and Scikit-learn  
- Linear regression for time-series forecasting  
- Lightweight model that can be converted to TensorFlow Lite (TinyML-compatible)

### 📂 Project Structure# tinyml-time-series-prediction
Simple project on lightweight time-series prediction using TinyML concepts
## 📂 Dataset
The data/sample.csv file contains a small synthetic time-series dataset used for testing the model.
It can easily be replaced with real industrial sensor data for further experiments.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Implementing the same prediction model using TinyML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Lite Micro).
- Running the model on low-power microcontrollers for real-time industrial monitoring.
- Extending the dataset with real-world factory data for model validation.
